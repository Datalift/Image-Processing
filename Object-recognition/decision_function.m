function [ set ] = decision_function( humts, centroid, covariance )
%DECISION_FUNCTION This function takes the seven computed Hu moments of an
%image, the centroid mu^k and the covariance of class Ci.
%   The return of this function is the outcome of the decission expression
%   (given in the practice exercise).
